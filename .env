# The .env file is used to store environment variables for your application.
# These variables are typically used to configure the application without hardcoding sensitive or environment-specific data.
# Examples of such variables include API keys, database connection strings, and application settings.

# Usage:
# 1. Create a .env file in the root directory of your project.
# 2. Define variables in the format: KEY=VALUE (e.g., API_KEY=your_api_key_here).
# 3. Use a library like 'dotenv' (for Node.js) or built-in support (e.g., Python's 'dotenv' package) to load these variables into your application.
# 4. Access the variables in your code using the respective environment variable access method (e.g., process.env.KEY in Node.js).

# Note:
# - Do not commit the .env file to version control (e.g., Git). Add it to your .gitignore file to keep sensitive data secure.
# - Provide a .env.example file with placeholder values to help other developers set up their environment.
